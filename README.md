Introduction
The Solent Student Travel Web App is an ambitious project aimed at tackling an everyday issue significant to the student experience at Solent University. The challenge centers around students' travel arrangements and experiences, crucial elements of their university journey. This platform is conceived as a specialized travel booking website designed specifically for students, with the intent to cater to their distinctive travel needs.

Students often yearn to visit their home countries or explore diverse regions from which their peers originate. Such journeys provide them with the opportunity to delve deeper into a specific country or region, immerse themselves in a new culture, or simply unwind on a sandy beach. Our proposed solution is to facilitate these travels within a tight budget and aligned with their academic schedules. Our overarching goal is to offer a comprehensive, enriching travel experience to our users, thereby creating a platform that fully comprehends and caters to the students' unique travel desires and restrictions.

**Core Features**
Exclusive Student Deals: Utilize our partnerships with major travel and hospitality chains to offer exclusive travel deals specifically tailored for students.

Personalized Holiday Flight Planning: The platform enables personalized flight planning, considering the academic schedules of the students.

Curated Travel Packages: We offer an array of curated travel packages designed to cater to the diverse preferences of the students.

**Technology Stack**
The Solent Student Travel Web App leverages a robust and modern tech stack. Key elements of this stack include React, Firebase, JavaScript, JSX, and Node.js.

**React**
React is a powerful JavaScript library renowned for building user interfaces. With React, we create reusable UI components, which results in more maintainable code.

**Firebase**
Firebase, a comprehensive app development platform, is used for user authentication and data storage in our platform. It simplifies the process of user sign-in and sign-out, ensuring an enhanced user experience.

**JavaScript and JSX**
JavaScript, a versatile, high-level scripting language, is vital for creating interactive web applications. Alongside JavaScript, we use JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, which simplifies writing and adding HTML in React.

**Node.js**
Node.js is a platform that allows for the execution of JavaScript code outside a web browser. It enables the running of the application on a local server during development.

**Getting Started**
Prerequisites
The platform can be accessed and used via CodeSandbox, an online code editor. To run this project, ensure that you have a CodeSandbox account. If not, you can create one for free at CodeSandbox.io.

**Setup**

1. Open Your VS Code.
2. Download this project.
3. Drag and drop this project inside VS code.
4. Open a terminal & run this command.
   run `npm i && npm start`

**CodeSandbox Setup**
Fork the project: Navigate to the project sandbox and click the "Fork" button to create your personal copy of the project.

Install dependencies: CodeSandbox automatically installs all the necessary dependencies for you. However, you can manually do it by opening a new terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal) and running the command: npm install.

Start the development server: CodeSandbox automatically starts a development server for you. If not, you can start it manually by running npm start in the terminal.

Access the application: You can now interact with the application in the browser panel on the right side of CodeSandbox.
